# MCAerial Documentation

This is the documentation for the MCAerial Mod, Minecraft, and Forge. You can find it at https://apo11o-m.github.io/MCAerial_Documentation/

You can also find the MCAerial Mod at https://github.com/apo11o-M/MCAerial_Mod

This documentation's intention is a note for myself as I learned & progress throughout minecraft modding, and it captures my best explanations and practices on those topics.

I also posted some of the most helpful guides and tutorials I found throughout the internet in the bottom of this page. Be sure to check them out!!
