# Registry Handler
Registration is the process of taking the objects of a mod (items, blocks, entities, sounds, etc.) and making them known to the game. Registering things is important, as without registration the game will simply not know about these objects in a mod and will exhibit great amounts of unexplainable behavior (and probably crash). The registry process happens in the Initialization stage during minecraft startup.
