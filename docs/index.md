# Welcome to MCAerial Mod Documentation!!

This is the documentation for the MCAerial Mod, Minecraft, and Forge. You can find this document at [GitHub](https://github.com/apo11o-M/MCAerial_Documentation).

It's intention is a note for myself as I learned & progress throughout minecraft modding, and it captures my best explanations and practices on those topics.

I also posted some of the most helpful guides and tutorials I found throughout the internet in the bottom of this page. Be sure to check them out!!
