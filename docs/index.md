# Welcome to MCAerial Mod Documentation!!
## Overview
This is the documentation for the MCAerial Mod, Minecraft, and Forge. You can find this [MCAerial Documentation](https://apo11o-m.github.io/MCAerial_Documentation/) on GitHub.

You can also find the [MCAerial Mod](https://github.com/apo11o-M/MCAerial_Mod) at my Github page.

This documentation's intention is a note for myself as I learned & progress throughout minecraft modding, and it captures my best explanations and practices on those topics.

I also posted some of the most helpful guides and tutorials I found throughout the internet in the end of this document. Be sure to check them out!!
