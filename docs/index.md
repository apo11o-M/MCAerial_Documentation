# Welcome to MCAerial Mod Documentation!!

## Overview
This is the documentation for MCAerial Mod, Minecraft, and Forge, and you can find this [MCAerial Documentation](https://github.com/apo11o-M/MCAerial_Documentation) on GitHub.

It's intention is a note for myself as I learned & progress throughout minecraft modding. It captures my best explanations and practices on those topics.

I also posted some of the most helpful guides and tutorials I found throughout the internet in the end of this document. Be sure to check them out!!
