# EventHandlers
Minecraft Forge provides event buses that are extremely useful for modders. The general concept is that you create "event handling" methods that subscribe a particular event, and being fired every time that event happens.

One example is the `PlayerUseItemEvent` where the player right clicks while holding an item. The dev can program that something happens when the player is holding a specific item and right clicks.
