# Model Files (.java & .obj files)
A model is simply, a shape. Most models in minecraft mods you found online are .json files with a few using .obj files as .obj is older and doesnâ€™t support many features like animation, materials and lights.

I also suggest downloading the JSON Editor Plugin from Eclipse marketplace. The plugin will highlight your syntax errors in the json files. Otherwise it will be like editing a plain text file with no highlights which is a pain to troubleshoot.

// show the syntaxes?
